# Xcode Snippets

A bunch of Objective-C code snippets [originally by Mattt Thompson](https://github.com/mattt/Xcode-Snippets), converted to `.codesnippet` for easy installation by [Nicolas Bouilleaud](https://github.com/n-b/Xcode-Snippets)

## Using Snippets

Just copy the snippets to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets/`.

Alternatively, use the [**Install System Plugin** tool](https://github.com/n-b/InstallSystemPlugins) and double-click the codesnippet files.

Or alternatively you could checkout the repo somewhere and run `rake install` from it's directory. It will create symbolic link from your checout into `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets`. For example I've added this repo as a submodule to my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/yas375/dotfiles).
